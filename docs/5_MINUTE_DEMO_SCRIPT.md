## Opening (30 seconds)

**"Welcome to DevAlign - an AI-powered Human Resource Information System designed specifically for intelligent IT project allocation.**

**DevAlign transforms how organizations manage their workforce by leveraging artificial intelligence to match the right people with the right projects. The system serves three key roles: HR Managers, Project Managers, and Staff members. Let's explore how each role benefits from DevAlign's powerful features."**

## Part 1: HR Manager - Employee Management (2 minutes)

**"First, let's step into the shoes of an HR Manager. When you log in as HR, you'll see four main modules: Dashboard, Employee Management, Project Overview, and Analytics. Today, we'll focus on the Employee Management feature - the foundation of our intelligent allocation system.**

**DevAlign offers two flexible approaches to onboard employees: Individual Entry and Bulk Import.**

### Individual Entry Demo

**"For individual entries, HR managers have two options:**

**Option 1 - Manual Entry: Simply fill in the employee's personal information, work details, skills, and role. The intuitive form makes data entry quick and error-free.**

**Option 2 - AI-Powered CV Extraction: This is where DevAlign shines. Upload an employee's CV in PDF format, and our AI instantly extracts all relevant information - name, email, phone number, skills, education, and experience. The AI processes the document in seconds, auto-filling the form and saving you valuable time."**

*[Demo: Upload a CV, show the extraction process, show auto-filled fields]*

### Bulk Import Demo

**"For organizations onboarding multiple employees, DevAlign provides a streamlined bulk import feature.**

**Step 1: Download our pre-formatted Excel template directly from the platform.**

**Step 2: Fill in your employee data - the template guides you with clear column headers and examples.**

**Step 3: Upload the completed Excel file back to DevAlign.**

**Within moments, all employees are added to the system."**

*[Demo: Click download template, show the Excel format, upload it]*

## Part 2: Project Manager - Intelligent Project Allocation (1.5 minutes)

**"Now, let's experience DevAlign from a Project Manager's perspective. Project Managers have access to three key modules: Dashboard, Project Management, and Team Overview. The crown jewel here is our AI-Powered Project Management system.**

### Creating a Project

**"To create a new project, managers follow a guided three-step wizard:**

**Step 1 - Project Details: Enter the project name, description, start date, deadline, required skills, and team size.**

**Step 2 - Team Selection: This is where DevAlign's AI truly demonstrates its power. Based on your project requirements, you have two intelligent options:**

**AI Recommendations: Our machine learning algorithm analyzes each employee's:**
- **Technical skill proficiency scores**
- **Past project performance**
- **Current workload and availability**
- **Skill match with project requirements**
- **Collaboration history**

**The system ranks employees by compatibility, showing you the best-fit candidates with detailed scoring breakdowns."**

*[Demo: Click "Get AI Recommendations", show the ranked list with scores and skill badges]*

**"Manual Browse: Alternatively, browse through all available staff with advanced filters. You can switch between AI recommendations and manual browsing seamlessly - DevAlign preserves both views so you can compare and make informed decisions."**

*[Demo: Toggle between AI and Manual tabs]*

**Step 3 - Review & Create: Review your selected team members and project details before finalizing.**

**"Once created, the project appears on your dashboard with real-time progress tracking, team member assignments, and upcoming deadlines."**

## Part 3: Staff - Collaborative Task Management (1 minute)

**"Finally, let's see DevAlign through a Staff member's eyes. Staff members have three modules: Dashboard, My Projects, and Profile.**

### Project & Task Access

**"From the My Projects page, staff can view all projects they're assigned to, complete with timelines, team members, and their specific roles.**

**Clicking into a project reveals the Task Board - a dynamic Kanban-style interface with columns for To Do, In Progress, and Completed tasks."**

*[Demo: Navigate to Projects → Select a project → Click Kanban Board]*

### Real-Time Collaboration

**"Here's what sets DevAlign apart: Real-time multiplayer collaboration. Watch what happens when multiple team members work simultaneously."**

*[Demo: Show two browser windows - one as Manager, one as Staff]*

**"When a staff member moves a task from 'To Do' to 'In Progress', the Project Manager sees it update instantly. No page refresh needed. When the manager adds a new task, the staff member sees it appear in real-time. Everyone stays synchronized, fostering seamless collaboration across distributed teams."**

*[Demo: Drag task in one window, show it update in the other window simultaneously]*
